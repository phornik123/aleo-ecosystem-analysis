- Solana maintains the largest active developer base with [Z] contributors
- [Add specific star/fork/contributor counts from your data]

### Ecosystem Overlap
- [X]% overlap between Aleo and Solana developers
- [Y]% overlap between Aleo and other ZK projects (Starknet, zkSync)
- [Add other interesting overlap statistics from your data]

### Developer Growth Opportunities
- Potential to target Solana's Rust developers given technical skill compatibility
- Zero-knowledge and privacy-focused developers from projects like Aztec and Mina show significant overlap
- [Add other insights from your analysis]

## Methodology
This analysis was conducted using GitHub API data for repository metrics and contributor information. The data was collected in April 2025 and represents a snapshot of the blockchain developer ecosystem at that time.# Aleo Developer Ecosystem Analysis
