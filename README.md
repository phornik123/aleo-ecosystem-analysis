# Aleo Developer Ecosystem Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains data and analysis of developer ecosystems across Aleo, Solana, and other ZK projects. The goal is to identify potential growth opportunities for Aleo's developer community.

## Key Findings

### Repository Analysis
Based on our data collection from GitHub repositories:

| Project | Stars | Forks | Contributors |
|---------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Aleo (Leo) | ~4,800 | ~1,500 | ~90 |
| Aleo (snarkOS) | ~4,400 | ~2,700 | ~93 |
| Solana | ~12,000 | ~3,400 | ~166 |
| Starknet | ~1,700 | ~599 | ~100 |
| zkSync Era | ~3,200 | ~2,100 | ~100 |
| Mina | ~1,000 | ~300 | ~100 |
| Scroll | ~1,500 | ~400 | ~65 |
| Aztec | ~1,000 | ~150 | ~100 |

### Ecosystem Overlap
Our analysis of developer overlap shows limited cross-ecosystem contribution:

| Ecosystem Pair | Common Developers | Overlap % |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Mina-Scroll | 2 | 3% |
| Starknet-Aztec | 2 | 2% |
| Mina-Aztec | 2 | 2% |
| zkSync-Aztec | 2 | 2% |
| Solana-Mina | 1 | 1% |
| Solana-zkSync | 1 | 1% |
| Starknet-Mina | 1 | 1% |
| Aleo-Others | 0 | 0% |

### Growth Opportunities
1. **Rust Developer Pool**: Solana's ecosystem of ~166 contributors represents the largest potential talent pool for Aleo due to shared Rust foundations.
2. **Privacy-Focused Developers**: Mina, Aztec, and zkSync contributors show interest in privacy solutions, making them potential targets.
3. **ZK Specialists**: Starknet and zkSync developers have experience with zero-knowledge technologies.

## Recommendations
1. **Target Solana's Rust Developers**: Create dedicated learning materials for Solana developers highlighting the similarities between Solana and Aleo's Rust environments.
2. **Enhance Documentation**: Improve Aleo's developer documentation to lower the barrier to entry for ZK development.
3. **Cross-Ecosystem Collaborations**: Explore partnerships with privacy-focused projects (Mina, Aztec) to increase developer overlap.

## Methodology
This analysis was conducted using the GitHub API to collect repository metrics and contributor data for key blockchain projects. Ecosystem overlap was calculated by identifying contributors who work across multiple projects.

## Data Collection
- Repository metrics were collected directly from GitHub API
- Contributor information was extracted from repositories' contributor lists
- Ecosystem overlap was determined by comparing contributor IDs across projects
